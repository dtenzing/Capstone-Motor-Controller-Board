# Capstone-Motor-Controller-Board
This repository contains the firmware and PCB files for the Motor Controller PCB which handles the power supply and control of the motors for the ASATS machine.

The "PCB Files" directory contains the KiCad project along with a README to see the progression of the project.

The code is being updated as the project is coming to a finish in the next few weeks, but a version of the code for a working prototype exists currently.
